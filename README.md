# Resque-Mission

This project is a continuation and enhancement of the original [Cube Revenge Game](https://github.com/cuboid0223/Cube_Revenge_Game) created by my senior. The original version served as a solid foundation for web-based 2D game development using HTML5 and JavaScript.

As part of my university final project, I took over the game and made several improvements to the visual presentation, gameplay mechanics, and educational interaction.

## 🎮 Project Overview

**Rescue-Mission** is a 2D browser-based adventure game where players take on the role of **Hou Yi (后羿)**, a mythical hero, as he embarks on a quest to rescue Chang’e (嫦娥). Players will explore various maps, interact with characters, and answer quiz questions to progress through the story.

The game combines simple action gameplay with knowledge-based challenges, designed specifically for **elementary school students** to learn while playing.
